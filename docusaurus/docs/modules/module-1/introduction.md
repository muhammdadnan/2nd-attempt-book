# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book. This module introduces you to Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), the middleware that serves as the "nervous system" for your humanoid robot.

## Overview

ROS 2 is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It's a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robot platforms.

In this module, you will:
- Understand the architecture and concepts of ROS 2
- Learn to create and manage ROS 2 packages and workspaces
- Work with nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Build your first ROS 2 packages for humanoid robot control
- Implement URDF for robot description
- Visualize your robot in RViz

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
1. Set up a ROS 2 development environment
2. Create and build ROS 2 packages
3. Understand and implement the core communication patterns in ROS 2
4. Create and visualize a URDF model of a humanoid robot
5. Implement basic robot control using ROS 2

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic knowledge of Linux command line
- Familiarity with Python or C++
- Understanding of basic robotics concepts

## Module Structure

This module is organized into the following chapters:
