# VLA Agent Implementation

The VLA (Vision-Language-Action) agent serves as the central intelligence orchestrating perception, reasoning, and action in the robotic system. This agent integrates all components into a cohesive system capable of understanding and executing complex commands.

## Agent Architecture

The VLA agent consists of:

- **Command Parser**: Interprets natural language commands
- **Task Decomposer**: Breaks high-level tasks into executable actions
- **Perception Manager**: Coordinates sensor data processing
- **Action Executor**: Manages navigation and manipulation execution
- **Feedback Handler**: Processes results and adjusts plans

## Decision Making

The agent uses a combination of rule-based systems and learned models to make decisions about task execution, resource allocation, and error recovery.
