# Manipulation Task Execution

Manipulation task execution enables the humanoid robot to perform complex object manipulation based on natural language commands. This system integrates perception, planning, and control to achieve robust manipulation in unstructured environments.

## Task Planning

The manipulation system performs hierarchical task planning:

1. **High-Level Planning**: Break down complex tasks into subtasks
2. **Grasp Planning**: Determine optimal grasp points and configurations
3. **Trajectory Generation**: Create collision-free motion paths
4. **Execution Monitoring**: Real-time feedback and adjustment

## Integration with VLA Pipeline

Manipulation tasks are triggered by language understanding components and guided by perception data, creating a seamless flow from command to execution.
