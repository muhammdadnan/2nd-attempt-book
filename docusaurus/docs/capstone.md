# Capstone Project: Building an Autonomous Humanoid Robot

The capstone project integrates all concepts learned throughout this book to build a complete autonomous humanoid robot system. This project demonstrates the full integration of ROS 2, simulation environments, Isaac AI capabilities, and the Vision-Language-Action pipeline.

## Project Overview

The capstone project involves:

- Designing a humanoid robot with ROS 2 compatibility
- Creating simulation environments in Gazebo and Isaac Sim
- Implementing perception, navigation, and manipulation capabilities
- Integrating natural language understanding for human-robot interaction
- Deploying the complete system on physical hardware

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: System Design
- Robot URDF design and validation
- Sensor placement and configuration
- Communication architecture planning

### Phase 2: Simulation Development
- Environment creation and testing
- Algorithm validation in simulation
- Performance optimization

### Phase 3: AI Integration
- Perception system deployment
- Navigation and manipulation integration
- VLA pipeline implementation

### Phase 4: Hardware Deployment
- Simulation-to-reality transfer
- Physical robot testing
- Performance validation

## Success Metrics

The project will be considered successful when the robot can:
- Navigate to specified locations autonomously
- Manipulate objects based on verbal commands
- Interact naturally with humans in the environment
- Adapt to changing conditions and recover from failures
