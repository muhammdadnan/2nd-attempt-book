# Glossary of Robotics Terms

This glossary defines key terms used throughout the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book.

## A

### Action
In ROS 2, a bidirectional communication pattern for long-running tasks with feedback. Actions are used for goals that take time to complete and require ongoing communication between client and server.

### Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
A type of artificial intelligence that can understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks at a human level or beyond, with the ability to transfer learning between domains.

## B

### Behavior Tree
A hierarchical structure used in robotics for organizing and controlling complex behaviors. Behavior trees provide a modular and reusable way to define robot actions and decision-making processes.

## C

### Cognitive Architecture
A blueprint for intelligent agent functionality, defining how information flows between components such as memory, perception, reasoning, and action selection.

### Computer Vision
A field of artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world. Computer vision algorithms process and analyze images and videos to identify objects, scenes, and activities.

## D

### Deep Learning
A subset of machine learning based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. Deep learning models can automatically discover relevant features from raw data through multiple layers of processing.

### Digital Twin
A virtual replica of a physical entity, system, or process that enables real-time monitoring, simulation, and optimization of the physical counterpart.

## E

### Embodied AI
Artificial intelligence systems that interact with the physical world through sensors and actuators. Embodied AI learns from and adapts to environmental interactions.

## F

### Forward Kinematics
The process of determining the position and orientation of a robot's end-effector based on the joint angles of its kinematic chain.

## G

### Gazebo
A physics-based 3D simulation environment used for robotics applications. Gazebo provides realistic sensor simulation and dynamically accurate interactions between objects.

### Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
A class of machine learning frameworks where two neural networks contest with each other in a zero-sum game framework. GANs are used for generating realistic synthetic data.

## H

### Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)
Software layer that allows higher-level software to interact with hardware without needing to know low-level hardware details.

### Humanoid Robot
A robot with a body structure that mimics the human form, typically featuring a head, torso, two arms, and two legs.

## I

### Isaac Sim
NVIDIA's reference application and framework for simulating robots and developing AI applications. Isaac Sim provides photorealistic rendering and physically accurate simulation.

### Inverse Kinematics
The mathematical process of determining the joint angles required to achieve a desired position and orientation of a robot's end-effector.

## L

### Language Model Integration
The incorporation of natural language processing capabilities into robotic systems to enable communication, instruction following, and semantic understanding.

## M

### Motion Planning
The computational problem of automatically determining a path for a robot to navigate from a starting position to a goal position while avoiding obstacles.

## N

### Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)
A technique for synthesizing novel views of complex 3D scenes based on a sparse set of 2D images. NeRF is used in robotics for 3D scene reconstruction.

## P

### Physics Engine
Software that simulates the behavior of physical objects, calculating motion, collisions, and forces to create realistic interactions in virtual environments.

### Point Cloud
A set of data points in space, typically representing the external surfaces of objects. Point clouds are often created by 3D scanners or depth cameras.

## R

### Reinforcement Learning
A type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions and receiving rewards or penalties. Used extensively in robotics for learning complex behaviors.

### Robot Operating System (ROS)
A flexible framework for writing robot software. It provides services designed for a heterogeneous computer cluster such as hardware abstraction, device drivers, libraries, visualizers, message-passing, package management, and more.

### ROS 2
The second generation of the Robot Operating System, offering improved security, real-time performance, and multi-platform support compared to ROS 1.

### ROS 2 Middleware (RMW)
The layer in ROS 2 that abstracts the underlying communication transport, allowing ROS 2 to work with different communication mechanisms like DDS implementations.

## S

### Sensor Fusion
The process of combining sensory data from multiple sources to achieve better accuracy and reliability than could be achieved by using a single sensor alone.

### SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)
The computational problem of constructing or updating a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of an agent's location within it.

### State Machine
A computational model used to design algorithms that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time. Used in robotics for behavior control.

## T

### Transformer Architecture
A deep learning model architecture that uses attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different parts of input data. Transformers are widely used in language models and increasingly in robotics.

## V

### Visual Servoing
A technique in robotics that uses visual feedback to control robot motion. Visual servoing adjusts robot actions based on real-time camera input.

### Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Model
An AI model that integrates visual perception, natural language understanding, and motor action planning to enable robots to follow complex instructions and interact with their environment.

## W

### Whisper API
OpenAI's speech recognition API that converts spoken language to text, enabling voice interaction capabilities in robotic systems.
